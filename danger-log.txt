Danger Log - Homework 2 HTTP Caching Proxy
Adam Krekorian - agk19

----------------------------

1) How is our code robust to external failures? What failures did we handle in the code? How do we handle them?
   If we have a socket connection/creation failure we do not close the server and instead move to the next request.

2) What is the exception guarantees that we make?

3) Our proxy server does not gracefully close.

4) If the cache entry requires validation and is validated we are just reading the entire response rather than returning the cached response.

5) We are not always freeing memory before it goes out of scope. This results in a lot of leaked memory.
